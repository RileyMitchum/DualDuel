# DualDuel

**************************************************
2v2 hourglass shaped map
control point 
3 min games
stand in control point area to earn tickets or kill enemy players
**************************************************


**************************************************
Options for how control point tickets could work:

- option 1: 
	- both players both teams on point = no tickets for either team
	- 1 player from team A and 2 from team B = 1 ticket per tick for team B
	- 0 players from team A and 2 from team B = 2 tickets per tick for team B

- option 2:
	- if a player from either team is on the point it is "contested" and no tickets are earned
	- tickets doubled if 2 players on point

- option 3:
	- if a player from either team is on the point it is "contested" and no tickets are earned
	- doesnt matter how many players on point for your team, earn 1 ticket per tick if uncontested
**************************************************	

**************************************************
killing players earns points
team with most points at end of game wins

2 roles - can only have 1 of each on your team: Damage and Utility

Utility:

- Utility focuses on protecting/enhancing the Damage while also keeping the enemy team off of the control point
- Provide shielding/healing/etc. to their ally and crowd control/debuffs to the enemy team.
- Deals little to no damage

Damage:

- Damage focuses on staying alive and killing the enemy team
- Skillshot heavy - think Ezreal over Vayne/Jinx
- Little to no escape or utility. Focuses on landing their abilities to deal damage.
